# AVR_DFPLAYER
DFPlayer library for AVR<br>

This is a library code for DFPlayer. <br>
DFPlayer product link : https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/DFPlayer_Mini_SKU:DFR0299<br><br>

I used reference manual from Flyron Technology Co., Ltd<br>
(http://www.flyrontech.com/edownload/6.html)<br>

This library was tested with Atmega328p MCU. <br>
You may need to change USART codes if you use diffent MCU of AVR family.

Some of features are not implemented such as feedback command.<br>
